This is a chatbot in VK. 
For the bot to work, create a unique token and insert it instead of the words 'YOUR TOKEN', having previously prepared a group for the bot. 
Write any message and the bot will send it to you. Fill in the list of bad words and if someone sends them, the bot will tell you about it.
In the future, using the blanks of this code, you can make the bot the moderator of this chat by filling in the list of forbidding words and issuing warnings and bans.

Good luck and see you soon!
